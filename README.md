OpenVPN server installation script, suitable for tech savvy [road warrior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_warrior_%28computing%29)s. Compatible with Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS.

This script will let you setup your own VPN server in no more than a minute, even if you haven't used OpenVPN before. It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.

In addition, it automatically maintains an internal malware blocklist based on the StevenBlac/hosts project.

### Installation
Run the script and follow the assistant:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superDuperCyberTechno/rockatansky/master/rockatansky.sh -O openvpn-install.sh && bash openvpn-install.sh`

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users, remove some of them or even completely uninstall OpenVPN.
